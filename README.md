A test repo for use in teaching people about RStudio projects

## 1 hour version
 * create a project in RStudio - just as in https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html
   * learn about options
   * learn about where to put stuff (folders: 
     - R
     - dataProcessing
     - dataAnalysis
     - data (?)
 * STOP: what happens if you over-write some code?
 * create a project in RStudio with git option
   * learn what git adds (version control via commits, additional commenting)
   * learn why NOT to keep your data in your RStudio project
   * this may break if git not installed
 * STOP: where do you keep your code and what happens if there's an "accident"?
   * Your own backups?
   * Otago [HCS](https://www.otago.ac.nz/its/services/hosting/otago068353.html)? - actually best for data
   * Otago [Syncplicity](https://its-faq.otago.ac.nz/index.php?action=show&cat=394)? - not clear what this is best for :-)
   * Dropbox? you might _not_ want to do this for several reasons
   * What else?
 * create a repo on github and create a new RStudio project from it
   * learn about READMEs
   * learn about licenses (digression on private repos/projects)
   * learn about commits, pull, push, history -> cloud code and collaboration (issues etc)
   * reminder of why NOT to keep your data in your RStudio project
   * this may break if git not installed and ssh keys not set (be prepared for delays while people get that sorted) 

## 2 hour version
(The 1 hour version might take 2 hours!)

 * Run 1 hour version
 * create a repo on github and create a new RStudio package from it
